# Trip Itinerary

This itinerary app is built to make the user's planning easier. 

It allows you to enter the name of the city of destination, start date and end date of the trip. Using the dynamic form, you can add however many places you want or remove if you like. 

Once the itinerary is created, you will see the weather of the city for the next five days, a map with all of your sites pinned with infowindows and, of course, the itinerary table.

Attraction sites are first sorted based on their distances from the latitude and clustered based on the commute distance between each place and the duration of the trip provided by you. 

An extra feature is events. You are free to add events to your plan depending on your availability or remove them if you like.

The app uses following APIs:
* Google Maps JavaScript API
* Open Weather API
* Event API offered by Predict HQ
